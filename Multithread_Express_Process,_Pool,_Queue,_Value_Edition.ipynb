        "Process: In this analogy, a process is like a separate bus with its own driver. Each bus (process) operates independently, serving its own route without interfering with others. You, as the station manager, oversee multiple buses (processes), coordinating their schedules and ensuring they run smoothly. Each bus can carry passengers and execute tasks (transportation operations) independently.\n",

        "Pool: Now, let's introduce the concept of a pool. Think of a pool as a fleet of buses available at your station. These buses (processes) are ready to be deployed whenever there's a demand for transportation services. As the station manager, you maintain this pool of buses, ensuring they're in good condition and ready to be assigned tasks (passenger pickups).\n",

        "Queue: A queue is like the line of passengers waiting to board the buses at your station. When passengers arrive at the station (tasks to be executed), they join a queue, patiently waiting for the next available bus (process) to pick them up. You manage this queue, ensuring fairness and efficiency in boarding passengers onto the buses (processes).\n",

        "#### Value :   ``` from multiprocessing import Value```\n",
        "Value from multiprocessing: In our analogy, the value from multiprocessing could represent the satisfaction of passengers reaching their destinations efficiently. As the station manager, you measure the success of your operation by how quickly and smoothly passengers are transported from one location to another. The value (satisfaction) increases when processes (buses) efficiently execute their tasks (transportation operations), minimizing wait times and congestion at the station.\n"

In our bus analogy, concurrency could be represented by multiple buses (processes) operating concurrently to transport passengers.
